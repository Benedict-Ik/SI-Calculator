# Simple Interest App v1.0

Here we begin styling and theming the Simple Interest app.

We learnt how to apply themes to the full app and specific parts of it.

We defined a general theme and embeded properties within using the **Theme** widget.

We called upon those properties inside other custom widgets via **Theme.of(context)** method which
basically allows you to retrieve the nearest Theme instance from the widget tree above the given BuildContext, and access predefined data such as color, fonts, etc.

We also converted the application's theme to dark mode
